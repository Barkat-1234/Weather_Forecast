Weather Forecasting ML Project Summary
üîç Project Title:

Weather Prediction: Forecasting Rain Using Machine Learning
üéØ Objective:

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow (RainTomorrow) based on current and historical weather data. This can help in planning outdoor activities, agricultural operations, and public safety measures.
üìä Dataset Overview:

    Source: weatherAUS dataset (originally from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology)

    Size: 145,000+ records of daily weather observations

    Features (23):
    Includes both numerical and categorical features such as:

        Date, Location

        Weather conditions: MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, Evaporation, Sunshine

        Wind data: WindGustDir, WindGustSpeed, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm, WindDir9am, WindDir3pm

        Humidity and pressure: Humidity9am, Humidity3pm, Pressure9am, Pressure3pm

        Cloud cover: Cloud9am, Cloud3pm

        Target Variables: RainToday and RainTomorrow (Yes/No)

üßπ Data Preprocessing:

    Handling Missing Values:

        Dropped rows with missing values for simplicity (can be improved later with imputation).

    Feature Engineering:

        Converted categorical features like RainToday and RainTomorrow into binary values (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

        Applied one-hot encoding to wind directions and other categorical fields.

    Dropped Unnecessary Columns:

        Removed Date and Location for this version.

ü§ñ Machine Learning Model:

    Model Chosen: Random Forest Classifier

        Why? It performs well with tabular data, handles both numerical and categorical variables, and is robust to overfitting.

    Train/Test Split: 80% training and 20% testing

    Performance Metric:

        Accuracy score was used to evaluate performance.

        The model achieved high accuracy, demonstrating strong performance in predicting rain/no rain.

üõ†Ô∏è Model Deployment: Streamlit Web App

A user-friendly Streamlit dashboard was developed to allow users to enter weather parameters and receive instant predictions:

    User Inputs: Min/Max temperature, rainfall, sunshine, humidity, etc.

    Prediction Output: Text-based output showing:

        ‚úÖ "Yes! It will rain tomorrow"

        ‚ùå "Nope! No rain tomorrow"

The model was serialized using pickle and loaded in the Streamlit app for real-time prediction.
üöÄ Deployment Plan:

    The app can be deployed on Streamlit Cloud or any web server with Python environment.

    Steps include:

        Hosting the code on GitHub.

        Connecting GitHub repo to Streamlit Cloud.

        One-click deployment to make the app live and shareable.
